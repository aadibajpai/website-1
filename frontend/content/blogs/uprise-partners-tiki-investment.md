[Uprise Partners](https://www.uprisepartners.com), a technology consultancy and investment firm headquartered in Maine,
has made a significant investment in TIKI, a technology startup giving consumers control over their own data and
monetizing it.

TIKI addresses a growing need for data privacy transparency and access that benefits users by affording them the ability
to see, control, and get paid for their data. With the TIKI app, users link their third-party accounts to control how
their data is used, including the option to sell it. While the current approach of collecting and monetizing data by big
tech companies generates massive profit for themselves, users are not currently able to monetize the information they
provide online.

“The Uprise team is led by Malinda and Brian Gagnon, two of the best people and industry experts. An Uprise investment
unlocks the ability for TIKI to operate more efficiently,” said TIKI Founder and CEO Mike Audi. “More importantly, they
specialize in bringing innovative products to millions.”

"We are super excited to bring Uprise Partners on as an investor and services partner,” added Anna Stoilova, TIKI’s
co-founder and CPO. “Getting access to their marketing and software development teams means we can scale our marketing
outreach and customer portal development much faster. The enthusiasm from Uprise has been great, and I look forward to
what we can do together."

Founded by Mike Audi and Brian Gagnon, TIKI addresses a growing need for data privacy control that benefits users. After
publicly launching the company at the end of October 2020, TIKI saw a significant influx of users amassing more than
100,000 sign ups since the beta opened three months ago.

Mike Audi leads TIKI as CEO while Brian Gagnon is a member of the TIKI board and serves as CTO at Uprise Partners. “It’s
exciting to see this idea come to life, and I’m thrilled with the team’s progress,” said Gagnon.

“I’ve seen firsthand how the world’s largest companies use consumer data to generate revenues,” said Malinda Gagnon, CEO
of Uprise. “With relatively new consumer data regulations like GDPR and CCPA, and overall consumer awareness about data
privacy and control, the tide is changing. People want and should have control over their own data and be able to
benefit from their data financially. That’s why I’m so incredibly excited about TIKI.”
