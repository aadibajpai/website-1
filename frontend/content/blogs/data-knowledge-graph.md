Our knowledge graph is a big deal.

But first: what the heck IS the knowledge graph?

The knowledge graph is a compilation of tens of millions of data points generated from our TIKI users. This is the driving factor for generating revenue on the business side of our project and enables businesses to purchase ethically sourced insights generated from our knowledge graph, with users compensated for the data they provided.

The anonymous data funneled into the knowledge graph allows for us to do numerous things, such as train AI, build analytic models, and do simple search and queries to generate actionable insights that businesses can use in real-time.

With our knowledge graph integration, the ability for millions of TIKI users to provide data points means the generated real-time insights are intricate, relevant, and extremely valuable. Most importantly for our users, the knowledge graph allows for users to stay completely anonymous while still providing businesses with the insights they crave.

As our integration list grows from GMail and Microsoft to Amazon, Netflix, Spotify and beyond, billions of data points will emerge on our knowledge graph. With this development, the road to monetization is much clearer. Make no mistake, this is a MASSIVE accomplishment.

Take a peek at Mike’s explanation video for a more in-depth look at the first version of this revolutionary technology:

Here’s another way to look at it (unleash the sports references!):

I read a brief and to-the-point post on the Red Sox subreddit the other day about the successes of the team over the past twenty years. It praised the nerdy way of doing things: making granular data-driven decisions to drive on-field success. By accepting the changing landscape of quantifying success in Major League Baseball in the 21st century, the Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, 2007, 2013 & 2018 and are four wins away from another championship appearance in 2021. A lot of that had to do with nerd stuff, or as baseball folks call it: sabermetrics.

This got me thinking specifically about how this relates to what we are building here at TIKI.

Our TIKI knowledge graph is to business decisions as sabermetrics is to baseball decisions. For example, when a baseball team is looking for a new third baseman, they may ask, “Who is better, Joe or Andy?” This isn’t exactly the question that they should be asking initially. A better question is, “What constitutes a successful third baseman?”

With analytics, it could be determined that the most successful third baseman possesses qualities A, B, C & D. Then the task is to determine who — Joe or Andy — possesses the most of these qualities.

Obviously this is a very simplified example, but this type of thinking is what has made the Red Sox so successful in the past two decades. It is also what has allowed for teams like the Tampa Bay Rays and Oakland Athletics, who have a miniscule budget compared to the Red Sox, to be successful over the years despite an obvious monetary competitive disadvantage.

Success in business (baseball included) has shifted to being able to ask the right questions. The “who” is just a product of analysis of the what, when, where, why & how.

This type of thinking plays perfectly into the TIKI model. With our knowledge graph, the “who” is not necessary. It can’t be: our users are all completely anonymous. The what, when, where, why, and how is all accessible via the billions of data points that will be funneled into our knowledge graph.

The question need not be “Who is my ideal target?” because the most useful answer is not “Joe” or “Andy.” The questions may be something akin to: “What constitutes an ideal customer?”

You may ask supplementary questions like, “What makes someone buy something from a competitor?” or “How do our customers interact with our content?” or “When is the best time to run a promotion?” From there you may establish that an ideal customer possesses qualities A, B, C & D. From there the possibilities are endless. What type of advertising converts someone with quality B? What is the relationship between quality A & D?

The entire point of our knowledge graph is to solve for the right questions or even to allow for you to formulate the right questions in the first place. Data-based decisions run the world. In pop culture, baseball is a definitive example of how the competitive landscape has changed as technology has become more advanced.

From a business perspective, not every company has the assets and luxuries that a major brand such as the Boston Red Sox possesses. But every company can have access to the insights that allow for the Red Sox to make the decisions that produce a successful product and therefore increased revenue.

Heck, the reality is, most businesses are more like the Tampa Bay Rays than they are like the Red Sox. But, being like the Rays means you have to look at and do things differently in order to find any competitive advantage. The Rays have been at the forefront of plenty of revolutionary ideas over the past decade because they had to be. They weren’t afraid to ask different questions and try different things. Despite a $63 million dollar payroll, the Rays finished first in their division in 2021 above the Red Sox ($160 million) and the New York Yankees ($220 million). Regardless of budget, our knowledge graph gives businesses the ability to find and utilize the insights that lead to victory.

And if you’re like the Red Sox, you have to be paying attention to the Rays of the world. The Sox (underdogs) just knocked the Rays out of the playoffs on Monday. But who’s the guy who put together the winning team? A fella named Chaim Bloom, a guy who orchestrated a whole new analytical model for putting together a winning team. His previous job was with… the Tampa Bay Rays.

By utilizing TIKI technology, organizations don’t need wunderkinds like Bloom or teams of opportunistic, thorough data scientists. With the right insights, you’re on the right path to making championship-caliber decisions. The unique structure of our knowledge graph is the key to unlocking these vital insights. Whether you’re more like the Rays, or more like the Sox, with TIKI, revolutionary data-driven decision making is at your fingertips. How’s that for “revenge of the nerds?”
