Running a business means asking a lot of questions.  

Is your location working for you? Is there a big enough market? Why do some customers turn to your competitor? 

From price points to packaging, it’s every business’ challenge to figure out their customers.  

TIKI makes it a whole lot easier.  

Businesses big and small can learn about their customers and their business using ethically sourced data from TIKI. We’re not talking reams of stats and analytics that require days to parse through, we’re talking easy-to-understand answers to your customer questions.  

Want to know who your customer is? TIKI can tell you.  

Curious about what your customers love about you? What they don’t love? Or why customers choose to do business with your competitor instead of you? TIKI can tell you that, too.  

Having access to customer data isn’t a new concept. We’ve surveyed and telemarketed and perused analytics reports since the dawn of time. Or at least since the dawn of clay tablet questionnaires.  

And these days we each create an immense amount of data about ourselves with everything we do – what we buy, who we email, the places we go, the comments we post, the videos we watch. Big companies gather that data and sell it to other big companies – and make a mighty fine profit in the process.  

It benefits the heavy hitters immensely. But small and medium-sized businesses are left out. Not to mention the fact that the data itself is created by users who often didn’t share it knowingly. We’re not cool with that. As a user or a business owner, you shouldn’t be, either.  

The TIKI app enables users  – anyone who uses email or social media or buys things, watches videos, or maps a road trip. 
 

We’ve talked a lot about the power of data control for users, and TIKI offers plenty of that. Users get to decide whether or not they share their data, how much is shared, and who gets to see it.  

When users do share, their data is anonymized – meaning, it’s not tied to them as an individual. How? 

We’ve built something pretty amazing: TIKI's Knowledge Graph.  

The Knowledge graph aggregates billions of anonymous user data points to ethically source marketing insights for businesses. This comprehensive picture of large groups of anonymous user data can be used by data-driven businesses for efficient targeting, customer understanding, financial decisions, and more.  ETHICALLY.

TIKI is a boon for businesses that want to know their customers better and do so in a way they can feel good about.  

We’re a by the people, for the people company, which is why we believe so much in transparency and why we’re making TIKI accessible and affordable to small and medium-sized businesses.
