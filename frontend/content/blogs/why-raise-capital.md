When raising capital, step 1 is why?

Building in public forces you to stay laser-focused on what you need to accomplish next.

For everyone not wrapped up in the jargon of Silicon Valley, building in public is a simple concept. Instead of building
in secrecy (called stealth) and then showing users once finished. You include them throughout the journey, so they
can see what you're building, why, and most importantly, weigh in. If you're reading this, you're probably already
familiar with our commitment to radical transparency. Everything at TIKI is public.

When we started TIKI, the question was, does anyone care? We're proud to say 100k people do. In 5 months, we defined our
message, mission, and vision, validating it with a scalable user acquisition program.

So, now what? Deliver the product to the 100k+ people who signed up.  

How do we do that as fast as possible? Hire more
engineers, at least until Anna can't keep up. Then more product people, followed by more engineers. I know it sounds
silly when it's put that blunt, but we've already established a large customer base. They've told us what they want;
now, it's our job to build it.

The more we raise (within reason), the faster (and more) we can build. It's that simple. We will be hiring mobile,
cloud, and blockchain developers. If that's you, send us a note at [careers@mytiki.com](mailto:careers@mytiki.com).

Anyone who's met me know's that I don't worry about the "competition," maybe frustratingly so. Here at TIKI, we're doing
our own thing. Additionally, I've been working on correcting a bad habit. In tech, everyone judges success by money
raised and valuation. Customers, not investors, define a company's success. It's a trap we all fall into if we're not
careful, TIKI included.

So, with all those caveats about competition & investment rounds, here are two proof points we're heading in the right
direction. Mine (saymine.com) & Jumbo (jumboprivacy.com) raised corresponding $9.5M & $8M Series A financing with
traction of 100k users (not signups, users).

Exciting times. The rocket moves faster and faster.
