Our founder Mike walks through a short demo of the "see" your data feature, which shows you the data that Google has on you. And it's not all unintelligible mumbo jumbo - it's in language we can all understand. 

It also informs you on other things you should know, like how this data is used by advertisers (you probably guessed that already) and law enforcement (that might be news to you). 

There are also tips for how to disable the collection of this kind of data. 

With TIKI, you decide what data companies collect, how they use it, and when they do, you get paid your fair share. Our unique data market makes your data anonymous and accessible by the millions of small businesses we actually care about, not just big budget corporations.
