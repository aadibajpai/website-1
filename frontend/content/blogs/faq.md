Got questions about what we are doing at TIKI? We hope this article will help answer questions you may have regarding
our app’s functionality.

## What is TIKI?

Simply put, TIKI is an app that allows you to sell your online data. As it stands, companies such as Facebook, Google,
and Amazon sell your data, usually without your knowledge, in exchange for free use of their service. With TIKI, you
have more control over your internet privacy, but, more importantly, you make money when you choose to sell your data.

## How does TIKI work?

TIKI allows you to sell your data. Usually, companies sell your data without your knowledge and you’re not compensated.
With TIKI, **you choose which accounts to link** (like Facebook and Google), which data to sell, and who can buy it. You
can stop, start, or change your settings at any point.

## How much do I get paid?

The amount that you get paid will depend on the accounts that you link and the amount of data you want to sell. To
start, we estimate you can get paid up to **$10/month**. We believe we can grow this to over **$100/month**.

## Is the TIKI app available to download now? 
A beta version with limited features is available now, and users are currently helping us test it! We’ve been excited to see so much interest in this early version and hear feedback on all the ways we can continue to make it even more useful, user-friendly, and awesome. Thanks to this interest, we’re rolling out beta access slowly. If you’d like to check out the beta and join the community of people helping us make TIKI great, sign up at https://mytiki.com/#signup. We’ll email you with instructions for downloading the beta app as we continue adding users and you’ll be in the know with all that’s happening behind the scenes. 


## What features are available in the app right now? 
Our initial focus is on Gmail and all the ways Gmail scans and stores what you do online. Currently on TIKI, you can connect your Gmail account and view Google’s activity tracking and delete or disable it, turning off ad personalization and smart features to stop Google from scanning your emails. Here’s why we’ve started with Gmail: [Why Gmail](https://mytiki.com/blog/why-gmail)

There are also tips for using a VPN and encrypted email. You’ll also be given a TIKI code to share with friends; you get $5 for every 10 people who join. 

To stay apprised of what we’re working on, what new features are being rolled out, as well as our overall timeline for launch, [see the product roadmap](mytiki.com/roadmap). And check out [product updates on our blog](https://mytiki.com/blog/category/product).


## When can I start getting paid?
Soon. But not quite yet. We’re eager to get TIKI launched, too, but want to make sure all the features work seamlessly first. The best way to see where we are in the process is the [product roadmap](mytiki.com/roadmap). We also post updates to [our blog](https://mytiki.com/blog/category/product).

## How do I stay connected with the TIKI Tribe, ask questions, or share feedback? 

If you have any questions, you can always chat to us directly in our community channels [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be), [Telegram](https://t.me/mytikiapp), or [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA66Eq2VHecpcCd-cu-dziozMRSH3EuQdcZJNyMOYNi5EhC0coWtjWzKQ1dDKEjMqhkP).  

## How do I sign up?

Sign up to take one of our limited spaces at [mytiki.com](https://mytiki.com/#signup)! We will then let you know shortly
before the launch to help you with the initial setup. We promise to never send you any spam emails.

## How does TIKI affect the accounts I link to it?

It simply doesn’t. We’ve all seen those “Login with your Facebook or Google account” buttons. It works like that.
Spotify, for example, uses Facebook to make it easy for you to follow your friends.

## How secure is TIKI?

We believe privacy is as important as security. We believe in real transparency; all of our code is public (no secrets
or backdoors). We believe in minimizing risk by storing the least amount of data for the least amount of time. We
believe that users should be in control of their data. You choose, not us.  
When every company (including FB) says security comes first, it feels hollow. So while yes, security comes first at
TIKI, we also do things very differently because we mean it.

## Can my data be linked to me as an individual?

No. Individual data is “de-individualized” so NO ONE ever sees any of your data. We package your data up into anonymized
“datasets” — that is, groups of data for thousands of people where no individual can ever be recognized.

## Are you making money from MY data then?

TIKI allows you to make money by selling your data. We don’t charge you and you get 100% of the proceeds from each sale.
Instead, we charge the buyers (businesses) a transaction fee for making it all happen. It is similar to how VISA charges
businesses rather than you each time you swipe your credit card.

## But you are still selling my data?

You choose to sell your data with TIKI. We’re just here to make it possible. You can sell as much as you’d like, or even
none at all. You can use our SEE and CONTROL features for free. We believe that all people should be the primary
decision-makers when it comes to their data.

## How can TIKI make my online experience more private and secure?

TIKI still works within the confines of the service being used, but we will recommend settings you can change in order
to have a more privatized experience. For example, on Instagram/Facebook, we can show you how to turn off facial
recognition. On most platforms, we can show you how to turn on targeted advertisements, etc. Companies’ Terms of Service
are often confusing and their settings are hard to use. We cut through the clutter for you.

## Can you sum this up quickly for me?

As it stands, businesses buy tons of data directly from services such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. With TIKI,
businesses can still gain valuable insights, but **YOU** are in control of the sale. You get all the proceeds of each
sale. And, if you just want a private experience without selling data, our **SEE** and **CONTROL** features are always
free to use.
