With 32 million small-medium businesses in the U.S. alone, TIKI's Steering Committee is a major step towards
democratizing safe, ethical insights about consumers for businesses of all sizes, where businesses – no matter their
size – can build their data on highly accurate insights collected ethically and affordably directly from their target
customers.

**Steering Committee members are industry leaders spanning a variety of data-driven markets.** For transparency, the member list will be regularly updated.

### Members List:
* **Brian Gagnon (Chairperson)** — Co-Founder and CTO, Uprise Partners

*Participation is voluntary and on an individual basis. It does not represent a personal or corporate endorsement of TIKI.*

>> “The ethical use and monetization of data is something the market has needed for quite some time. By bringing together such a diverse group of industry leaders, we’ll be able to understand how data-driven companies think about challenges related to data collection and usage in the market today.” — Brian Gagnon, Chairperson

According to a [recent Forrester survey](https://www.collibra.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Business-Impact-of-Data-Intelligent-Management_FINAL.pdf), 84% of businesses believe data is crucial to business decisions and strategy,
and 64% planned to increase investment in data management technology over the next two years. Businesses that base
decisions on data — not instincts or experience — are [19 times more likely to be profitable](https://cognopia.com/data-driven-business-the-ultimate-guide/).

>> “The Steering Committee represents a breakthrough for TIKI as both a lens on the data industry but also an experienced peer group to review new ideas. The current and future members of this committee understand the need for a better solution to build trust with customers and more ethically use data to power their businesses. This is a huge milestone for TIKI and the data market overall.” — Barry O’Connor, Data Market Leader.
