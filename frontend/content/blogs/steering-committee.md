According to a [recent Forrester survey](https://www.collibra.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Business-Impact-of-Data-Intelligent-Management_FINAL.pdf), 84% of businesses believe data is crucial to business decisions and strategy,
and 64% planned to increase investment in data management technology over the next two years. Businesses that base
decisions on data — not instincts or experience — are [19 times more likely to be profitable](https://cognopia.com/data-driven-business-the-ultimate-guide/).

The current and future members of this committee understand the need for a better solution to build trust with customers and more ethically use data to power their businesses. This is a huge milestone for TIKI and the data market overall.” — Barry O’Connor, Data Market Leader.
