Helping you take control of your online data is what the TIKI app is all about. We're working hard to make it as simple as possible for you to see what data of yours is being collected and to decide whether you want that data shared or not.

We’re adding features to the beta app all the time, but wanted to share some easy ways you can start managing your data right now: 

## 1. Stop Gmail from scanning your emails
Gmail knows what you’ve written to your friends. 
Gmail reads, stores, and analyzes every single one of your emails. That data is used for targeted ads and what they call “smart features,” like automatically adding your flight information to your calendar. 

Not loving the thought of Gmail knowing all your business? You can turn off both ad personalization and “smart features” to stop Google from scanning your emails: [support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10079371).


## 2. View your Google activity history (and delete it or disable tracking altogether)

We know Google tracks our activity. But to actually SEE IT all there - every word searched on google.com, every location you looked up in maps, every true crime video you watched on YouTube, not to mention what time it was and which device you were on - just feels gross.
To see what your tracked activity looks like (and delete it, set it to auto-delete, or disable activity tracking altogether) go to [myactivity.google.com/myactivity](https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity).


## 3. Hide your IP with a VPN or use an encrypted email service

Your IP is used like a fingerprint, connecting your personal data and online behavior (the websites you visit, the emails you open, the people you email and how often). 
Apple just announced it’ll allow users to shut off the tracking of their behavior in Apple’s Mail app and hide IP address information that enables the tracking of your online behavior in the Safari browser. That’s awesome. (Read more about that: ["Apple’s Tim Cook Kicks Off WWDC by Doubling Down on Privacy")](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-annual-developer-conference-caps-a-tense-year-11623058201). 
But what else can WE do about it? 

We can use a VPN, like nordvpn, to hide our IP addresses: [nordvpn.com](https://nordvpn.com/).

Or, for true anonymity, we can switch to an encrypted email service like ProtonMail: [protonmail.com](https://protonmail.com/).
