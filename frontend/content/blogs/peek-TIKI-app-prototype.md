Hey y‚Äôall, ready to see what the TIKI app will look and feel like? We're excited to share a peek at the prototypes! 

Below you'll find links our designs for two protoypes: 

**1. What we‚Äôre building in June/July**

**2. Our long-term Product Vision (where we want to be in a few months/a year‚Äôs time)**

Note: Both links are going to a page called ‚Äúdesign prototype," and the prototype is best viewed on a desktop. These aren't final versions, of course, and we'd love to hear your feedback. More on that, and links to the protypes, are below!

## üé®What is a design prototype?

A design prototype shows how the app will look and feel, as well as some basic actions that you can take in the app (like swiping, or pressing a button).
This is not the real app in action, it‚Äôs a mock up and it is not meant to work or be used as an app.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why is it needed?

Design prototypes imitate how the app will look and feel in a very realistic way, so that valuable user feedback is collected. The idea is that, even before building the app, we know what works and what doesn‚Äôt, what users like you find useful, or what confuses them, etc. The more we know, the better product we can actually build!
This is why we need your help in providing us feedback and opinions‚Ä¶

## üíÅ What do you need from me?

We need you to be as honest as possible, and tell us about your experience in as detailed way as possible.
Don‚Äôt worry! You won‚Äôt hurt my feelings, or anyone from TIKI‚Äôs, as this is our job ‚Äî to make a product that works for you, not just for us‚Ä¶

## ü§î How to provide feedback

You can either leave comments in the prototypes (by pressing the C button on desktop), or chat to us directly on our Discord, Telegram or Signal channels.

Let us know:

- Your overall feelings about it
- What you like
- What you don‚Äôt like
- What‚Äôs confusing you (any questions that you have)
- What‚Äôs easy to understand
- What you‚Äôd do with it / how you‚Äôll use it

Ok, got it, now show me‚Ä¶

In the prototype below, we‚Äôd like to show you what we‚Äôre building next over the next month (June/July 2021). For more details, [see our roadmap.](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/206e9e86c520468ea604e057c0f0dea7?v=20062bf2771d4952840f862334a6cfc5)

## What are you building after?

In the 2nd prototype below is our so called ‚ÄúProduct Vision‚Äù piece, which is showing what we want to create in around a year‚Äôs time.

## Is this all final?

No, none of these prototypes are the final app design!

Design, as well as development is ongoing, circular process ‚Äî so we constantly need your feedback, thoughts and ideas. Have a look at [our roadmap](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/206e9e86c520468ea604e057c0f0dea7?v=20062bf2771d4952840f862334a6cfc5) to see what we‚Äôve planned. Also, [our feedback channel](https://feedback.mytiki.com/), as well as [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be) keep taking requests, go for it and let us know what you want!
