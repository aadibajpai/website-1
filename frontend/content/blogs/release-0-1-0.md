Hello Tiki Tribe! This has been an exciting week as we begin rolling out features from our [product roadmap](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/206e9e86c520468ea604e057c0f0dea7?v=20062bf2771d4952840f862334a6cfc5)! First up - [Gmail integration.](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/Link-Gmail-account-9fcff4e017f44cfbb238e1a5b128b201)

##Why we’re starting with Gmail…

Most everyday email users (specifically Gmail users in this case) do not know how critical their email is to privacy and data security. Any app you sign up for, anything you buy online, or anything you subscribe to uses your email address. Big tech companies such as Google use your email data, including [everything you’ve ever written](https://medium.com/mytiki/why-gmail-87f4d6704c63) (yes, you read that right) and your preferences to get to know you and analyze your behaviours. This data is super valuable as it can be sold to advertisers and used for ads personalization.

##What’s in this release?

This update from TIKI allows you to link your Gmail account and see all the data that they have on you, with links to where you can turn this off. Gmail collects a lot of data on you, including the contents of your emails!

##What’s coming next?

Next, we’re working on exciting new features allowing you to see more information from the companies that might be spamming you, or simply sending you lots of emails that you don’t really open… Expect more news and prototypes on this soon, as we are working faster than ever to get the product up and running.

##Stay tuned for more!

We are so excited to share these news! The best part of this announcement is that this is the beginning of a set of features that give you transparency of how your data is used by various apps. This just the first step of taking ownership and control over YOUR data. We’re starting the revolution today!

As always, we want to hear your feedback as TIKI is an app for USERS. Please test out these features and share your thoughts on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be), [Telegram](https://t.me/mytikiapp) or [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA66Eq2VHecpcCd-cu-dziozMRSH3EuQdcZJNyMOYNi5EhC0coWtjWzKQ1dDKEjMqhkP) or our social channels.
