## 07.14.21: Release 0.2.0

We’re super happy to announce that our new release (0.2.0) is here which brings a new interface to the TIKI app and sets the foundations of what we’re releasing next.

### Why we’re releasing this:

To put the foundation of what we’re building next, we had to create new areas of the app, add a menu and an account management section. This puts the foundation for the first “control” feature coming next — the ability to unsubscribe from mailing lists.   

### What's in this release:
This update from TIKI includes a totally new interface which allows you to navigate between the various sections of the app, and additional sections giving a sneak peak of what’s coming next. You’ll be able to:

- Navigate between the different sections of the app (Data/Choices/Money)
- Link your Gmail account and see what data Gmail holds on you
- See a new “money balance” screen where you’ll be able to see the total of your referral earnings
- Access your account and see our updates and your Beta tester badge
- As for the “Choices” area — this is what we’re building next, and this will be the area where you’ll make choices on which companies email you, how often and decide what to do about them.

### What’s coming next?

Next, we’re working on an exciting new feature we call ["Unsubscribe from SPAM"](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/Unsubscribe-from-SPAM-functionality-1f177a0ea0ea4d4e8ddc8a766ee50731) allowing you to see more information from the companies that might be spamming you, or simply sending you lots of emails that you don’t really open… Expect the functionality to be live in the next couple of weeks.


All yours,
**Anna and the TIKI team**
