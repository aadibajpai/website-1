      Welcome to the TIKI tribe! Due to exciting but overwhelming demand, we are
      slowly adding more and more people to the beta (it's quite buggy ðŸ¤«).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Your spot is reserved.</b> We add more users every month, so keep an
      eye out for your invite!
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your support and patience; we can't wait for you to get your
      hands on the app!
